//     This is part of ex_sensors, an example on how to implement sensors
//     for enemies in C++. It is a simple textmode game that has two game modes: 
//     Easy and Hard. This implementation adds a third mode: Sensors. In this
//     mode, enemies created have sight sensors and stop moving when they see
//     the player in its line of sight.
//     This example was used during Videogame Programming lessons at the 
//     Multimedia Degree from the University of Alicante (Spain). You may
//     watch the associated lesson at https://youtu.be/mPapuUC0kLg
